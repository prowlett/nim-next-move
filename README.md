# Nim - next move?

Uses LuaTeX to generate a set of questions of the form 'What is the optimal next move in the following game of Nim?' Build with lualatex. Different questions are generated each time you build.

## Settings

The following parameters can be set in the code.

`min_heaps`: minimum number of heaps in a Nim game.

`max_heaps`: maximum number of heaps in a Nim game (line wrapping goes a bit weird wrt display).

`min_sticks`: minimum number of sticks in a Nim heap.

`max_sticks`: maximum number of sticks in a Nim heap.

`num_games`: number of games to generate in the questions list.
